# Downloader App

This app provides a simple interface for users to download large files from the internet directly to their devices. The app is designed with a focus on ease of use, featuring a one-screen layout and background download capabilities.

## Features

- **Single Screen Interface**: The app consists of a single screen with a prominent download button in the center to initiate the download process.
  
- **Progress Widget**: A progress widget on the main screen provides real-time feedback on the download progress and status.
  
- **Background Download**: Users can start a download and exit the app, with the download continuing in the background.
  
- **Notifications**: If the app is not active, users will receive notifications about the download progress or status.
  
- **Notification Management**: When the user returns to the app, any active notifications are dismissed, and the download status is updated on the app screen.
